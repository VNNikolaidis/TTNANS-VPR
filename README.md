# TTNANS-VPR
Pattern Recognition and Data Analysis Software that was created around 1995 and later.

VPR has an MS-Windows shell, while TTNANS was the text-only (console) version (with versions for MSDOS and Amiga Workbench)
Later, some ideas evolved and parts were incorporated Noesis Pattern Recognition Software.
