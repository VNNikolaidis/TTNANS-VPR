# TTNANS-VPR
Pattern Recognition and Data Analysis Software written in C++ and created around 1995 as part of my PhD work.

Contains a collection of methods for clustering and classification of numerical data,  both unsupervised and supervised training, including conventional (like k-Means), Neural Network (like BP), and custom ones. 

VPR has a MS-Windows shell, while TTNANS was the text-only (console) version (with versions for MSDOS and Amiga Workbench). Both assume data is in text files as numerical 2d matrices (columns = variables, rows = cases).

Later, some ideas evolved and parts were incorporated to Noesis Pattern Recognition Software.
