# TTNANS-VPR
Pattern Recognition and Data Analysis Software written in C++ and created around 1995 as part of my PhD work.

VPR has a MS-Windows shell, while TTNANS was the text-only (console) version (with versions for MSDOS and Amiga Workbench).

Later, some ideas evolved and parts were incorporated to Noesis Pattern Recognition Software.
